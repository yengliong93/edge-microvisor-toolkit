# Edge Microvisor Toolkit

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](./LICENSE)

The Edge Microvisor Toolkit is a streamlined container host that
showcases the Intel silicon optimizations. Built on Azure Linux, it features a
Linux Kernel maintained by Intel, incorporating all the latest kernel and user
patches.

It is published in several versions, both immutable and mutable. Use them to
quickly deploy and run your solutions for multiple scenarios, like benchmarking
and validation of edge AI computing workloads, or build your own system, using
the existing infrastructure.

The currently published versions are:

* Edge Microvisor Toolkit (immutable)
* Edge Microvisor Toolkit with real time extensions (immutable)
* Edge Microvisor Toolkit Standalone (immutable) ([Download link](https://edgesoftwarecatalog.intel.com/details/?microserviceType=recipe&microserviceNameForUrl=edge-microvisor-toolkit-standalone-node))
* Edge Microvisor Toolkit Developer (mutable) ([Download link](https://edgesoftwarecatalog.intel.com/details/?microserviceType=recipe&microserviceNameForUrl=edge--microvisor-toolkit-development-node))

The Edge Microvisor Toolkit has undergone extensive validation across all Intel
platforms such as  Xeon®, Intel® Core Ultra™, Intel Core™ and Intel® Atom®. It
provides robust support for integrated and Intel discrete GPU cards, as well as
integrated NPU.

You can either build the Edge Microvisor Toolkit by following step-by-step
instructions or download it directly. Both the Build system and the Edge Microvisor
Toolkit are available as Open-Source.
