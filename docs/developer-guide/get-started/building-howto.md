# Build an Edge Microvisor Toolkit Image

Edge Microvisor Toolkit is a downstream of Azure Linux. It is composed of multiple modules to
facilitate creating `rpm` based OS images supporting a variety of different image formats.

The toolkit has an `imageconfig` construct in the JSON format that defines the characteristics
of the resulting image, such as:

- Type and size of partitioning table.
- Partitions, their types (such as EFI, rootfs, etc.), settings, file system, and size.
- Reference to `packagelists` which defines what packages (i.e. `rpms`) should be included in
  the image.
- Additional configuration files that should be embedded in the image (e.g. network-, systemd
  configurations).
- Any required post-installation scripts that should be executed once the image has been
  generated.
- Kernel and command line options.
- Final configuration properties that should be applied (e.g. enable full disc encryption,
  immutable image, second stage bootloader provider, purge documentation etc.).

Before you can build OS images you need to build the toolchain and make sure to
[**install pre-requisites (Ubuntu)**](/toolkit/docs/building/prerequisites-ubuntu.md).

The toolkit can use prebuilt packages for building the OS images. This is the recommended
approach, as building the *entire toolchain* may take a lot of time. Adding the
`REBUILD_TOOLCHAIN=y` parameter to the `make` command rebuilds the entire toolchain.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <Microvisor git repo>
cd <Microvisor repo>

# Checkout stable branch of Microvisor
git checkout <latest stable>

# Build the tools
cd ./toolkit
sudo make toolchain REBUILD_TOOLS=y
```

## Building the Default Microvisor Image

Multiple image configurations are located in the `imageconfigs` folder:

```bash
microvisor/
├── docs/
├── LICENSES-AND-NOTICES/
├── SPECS/
├── SPECS-EXTENDED/
├── SPECS-SIGNED/
└── toolkit/
    ├── docs/
    └── imageconfigs/
      ├── edge-image-dev.json
      ├── edge-image-rt-dev.json
      ├── edge-image-rt.json
      ├── edge-image.json
      ...
      └──
  ...
```

To build the default microvisor image based on its `imageconfig` file, run the following
command:

```bash
sudo make image -j8 REBUILD_TOOLS=y REBUILD_PACKAGES=n CONFIG_FILE=./imageconfigs/edge-image.json
```

## Customizing an Image

To add packages to the default image, you can define your own `packagelist.json`  file,
pointing to `rpms` that should be included in the image. The `edge-image.json` file points to
multiple `packagelist` files, located under `imageconfigs/packagelists`. The same `rpms` may
be included in an `imageconfig` file through the `packagelist` files. The resulting image
will include the set of all `rpms` specified within the array of `packagelist` files from the
`imageconfig`.

### Example: Adding Nano

The following example shows how to add `nano` as an alternative text editor to the image.
You can add the packages for which `.spec` files already exist. Simply include them in an
existing `packagelist` file, or create a new one and add it to the `imageconfig`.

```bash
# Create a new packagelist called utilities.json
cat <<EOF > ./imageconfigs/packagelists/utilities.json
{
    "packages": [
        "nano"
    ]
}
EOF

# Edit the edge-image.json file to add custom packagelist and default login account for testing.
...
"PackageLists": [
  "packagelists/core-packages-image-systemd-boot.json",
  "packagelists/ssh-server.json",
  "packagelists/virtualization-host-packages.json",
  "packagelists/agents-packages.json",
  "packagelists/tools-tinker.json",
  "packagelists/persistent-mount-package.json",
  "packagelists/fde-verity-package.json",
  "packagelists/selinux-full.json",
  "packagelists/intel-gpu-base.json",
  "packagelists/os-ab-update.json",
  "packagelists/utilities.json"
],
"Users": [
  {
      "Name": "user",
      "Password": "user"
  }
],
...
```

Then, rebuild the image:

```bash
sudo make image -j8 REBUILD_TOOLS=y REBUILD_PACKAGES=n CONFIG_FILE=./imageconfigs/edge-image.json
```

### Update or Add Packages

1. If a new package has to be released, follow these steps to ensure the package is available
   in the artifactory:

    a. Checkout the tag for your agent which has to be released.
    b. cd into your agent's directory.
    c. Invoke `make tarball`.
    d. Upload tarball from `build/artifacts` to the tarball repository.

2. Update the respective .spec file in SPECS/`package` directory. Example: `SPECS/node-agent`.

3. Bump the release number declared in the top section of the .spec file if on the same
   version. Otherwise, update the release version and set the number to 1.

4. Update `env_wrapper.sh` and the .spec file if there are installation changes or new
   configurations to be added.

5. Update the changelog to ensure the version and release number are mentioned correctly as
   well. Example:

    ```bash
    * Tue Mar 25 2025 Andrea Campanella <andrea.campanella@intel.com> - 1.5.11-2
    - Move from RSTYPE to RS_TYPE in wrapper for node-agent
    ```

6. Generate sha256sum of all files that have been updated.
Example : `sha256sum ./SPECS/node-agent/env_wrapper.sh`

7. Update the signature file name `<agent-name>.signatures.json`. Example: `node-agent.signatures.json`.

8. Update `cgmanifest.json`. You can use a script to do it, if you have an RPM environment.
   Otherwise, update the version and download the URL manually. Example commands to update
   using a manifest:

    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install -r ./toolkit/scripts/requirements.txt
    python3 ./toolkit/scripts/update_cgmanifest.py first cgmanifest.json ./SPECS/node-agent/node-agent.spec
    ```
