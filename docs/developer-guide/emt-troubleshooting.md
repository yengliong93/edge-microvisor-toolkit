# Edge Microvisor Toolkit Troubleshooting

This section provides additional tips and suggestions for common questions
and issues users may run into.

::::{dropdown} How do I verify the integrity of a microvisor image?
Each build artifact offers a corresponding SHA256 checksum file that can be used to ensure
the integrity of the original image file.

- Linux
  ```bash
  sha256sum -c full-3.0.20250320.0243.iso.sha256sum
  20250320.0243/full-3.0.20250320.0243.iso: OK
  # Manually
  sha256sum 20250320.0243/full-3.0.20250320.0243.iso
  85b137474ec0b9bd79f8573af56f80888cef2f34e6c0649da79dfb58aa28a3bb  20250320.0243/full-3.0.20250320.0243.iso
  ```

  > **Note:**
    When using `sha256sum` with the `-c` option, ensure that the image is located in the
    expected directory. In this case `/20250320.0243`.

- Windows
  ```winbatch
  > certutil -hashfile full-3.0.20250320.0243.iso SHA256
  SHA256 hash of full-3.0.20250320.0243.iso:
  85b137474ec0b9bd79f8573af56f80888cef2f34e6c0649da79dfb58aa28a3bb
  CertUtil: -hashfile command completed successfully.
  ```

::::{dropdown} Edge Microvisor Toolkit does not boot. I'm trying to run it as a VM.
- Hypervisors may not support custom platform keys for secure boot. If secure
  boot is enabled, the VM will not boot as it cannot verify the signature. Make sure
  that secure boot is disabled in your hypervisor settings.
- Check if the boot order is configured properly. If you have run the ISO
  installer, verify that the VHD (Virtual Hard Drive) has the highest priority, so the
  VM does not attempt to boot from USB or PXE (Network Boot).
- Under settings, make sure EFI is enabled and supported by the hypervisor.

::::{dropdown} How many CPUs and how much memory should I allocate?
While Edge Microvisor Toolkit will work with constrained devices or VMs,
it is recommended to have at least 4 CPUs and 4096MB of memory. For quick
testing purposes, you can boot and evaluate Edge Microvisor Toolkit with as little as
a single CPU core with 1024MB of memory.
::::


::::{dropdown} How much CPU and memory does Edge Microvisor Toolkit consume when idle?
With a *single* CPU core, you should see idle consumption to be around 300MB of memory and
on average 3-7% CPU utilization.
::::


::::{dropdown} How much disk space do I need to allocate for Edge Microvisor Toolkit?
It really depends on your usage scenarios, but Edge Microvisor Toolkit
requires about 750MB of disk space for the root filesystem. The VHD and RAW
images are preallocated with 2GB across the partitions.
::::


::::{dropdown} How do I install additional rpm packages?
The immutable images (RAW, VHD) have a read-only filesystem and you cannot install any
additional packages to the root filesystem.

- You can install the ISO image and additional rpm packages from the Open
  Edge repository that are pre-configured in the image. There are over 3000
  packages available.
- If you need to enable additional packages in the immutable image, you need
  to add the rpm(s) to an image file. You can use an existing image or create a new one.
- If a .spec file does not exist for the rpm you want to add to your image,
  you need to create it as well.
::::


::::{dropdown} I have an rpm that is not available in the Open Edge repository, how do I install it?
If you are using the ISO build, you can configure additional
repositories by creating a repository configuration file.
```bash
[custom-repo]
name=My Custom Repository
baseurl=https://example.com/path/to/repo
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://example.com/path/to/RPM-GPG-KEY-myrepo
```
- `enabled`: Set to `1` to enable the repo.
- `gpgcheck`: Set to `1` to enable GPG signature verification.

Finally, you can refresh the `tdnf` cache.
```bash
tdnf clean all
tdnf makecache
```

::::{dropdown} How do I install docker and install containers?
Packages can be installed on Edge Microvisor Toolkit Developer image with `tdnf`
. Follow these steps to install the container runtime and the docker-cli.

Install Docker (Moby)

```bash
sudo tdnf install -y moby-engine moby-cli containerd
```
Enable and start the Docker service

```bash
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
```

Optionally, add user to the docker group to avoid running as sudo

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

Verify installation

```bash
docker version
docker info
docker run hello-world
```

Optionally, install docker compose

```bash
sudo dnf install docker-compose
```

::::{dropdown} How do I configure proxy settings in Edge Microvisor Toolkit?
Most applications will pick up proxy environment variables, so you can export
environment variables for `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, `HTTP_PROXY`,
`HTTPS_PROXY` and `no_proxy` to your `~/.bash_rc` profile.

If you need to configure system wide proxy settings you can follow these steps:

1. Create a file under `/etc/profile.d/proxy.sh`
1. Export your proxy settings in the `proxy.sh` file
1. Make the file executable `chmod +x /etc/profile.d/proxy.sh`

The supported package managers, `dnf` and `tdnf` also need to have proxy settings
configured. To add those, create or append the current file for each package manager
under `/etc/dnf/dnf.conf` and `/etc/tdnf/tdnf.conf` respectively.

```bash
[main]
...
proxy=http://proxy.example.com:3128/
proxy_username=myuser   # add if your proxy requires authentication
proxy_password=mypass   # add if your proxy requires authentication
```

::::{dropdown} Will my home directory be saved if I perform an update of Edge Microvisor Toolkit?
Yes, the entire `/home` directory is configured as a persistent bind mount and will be kept
across updates. This is true for other key directories as well.
::::


::::{dropdown} Is virtualization supported in Edge Microvisor Toolkit?
Yes, Edge Microvisor Toolkit offers native support for virtualization through KVM/qemu.
You can install it as a bare-metal or a host operating system and run guest operating systems
on top.
::::


::::{dropdown} Is SRIOV supported in Edge Microvisor Toolkit?
Yes, SRIOV is supported at the kernel level in Edge Microvisor Toolkit.
::::


::::{dropdown} Does Edge Microvisor Toolkit support NVIDIA GPUs?
NVIDIA GPUs are not currently supported.
::::


::::{dropdown} Are the microvisor images signed?
Yes, the production images are signed by Intel®. Since the UKI is signed, BIOS needs to be
configured with these keys.
::::


::::{dropdown} How do I add a Kernel module (.ko) file?
It depends on which microvisor image you are using.

- Mutable ISO image: You can add or update modules at runtime. Standard commands like
  `insmod` or `modprobe` enable you to load a downloaded or newly built .ko file.
  The file system is writable, plus the `dm‑verity` feature is not enabled,
  so you can modify or add kernel modules as needed.
- Immutable Image: The OS image is read-only; you cannot download or add new .ko
  files after deployment. If a module is needed, it must be included in the system
  image at build time. Assuming the module is a part of the verified image, you can
  load it using the usual methods (`insmod` or `modprobe`). `dm‑verity` ensures the
  integrity of the image, so any module loaded must match the signed, verified
  version in the image.
::::

::::{dropdown} How do I change the kernel command line (e.g. Huge Pages)?
It depends on which microvisor image you are using.

- Mutable ISO image: You can modify the kernel command line by updating the bootloader
  configuration (`/etc/default/grub`) and then regenerate the configuration by
  running `grub-mkconfig`.
- Immutable Image: You cannot change the kernel line currently without rebuilding
  the image as the command line is included in the UKI and signed. The kernel
  command line can be modified in the image file (e.g. `edge-image.json`). The
  `KernelCommandLine` JSON attribute can be updated to include desired kernel command
  line parameter(s).
::::

::::{dropdown} What do the many JSON files in imageconfigs do? Which needs to be modified for the ISO or the immutable OS image?
For more details, see the [Build an Edge Microvisor Toolkit Image](./get-started/emt-building-howto.md)
article. The `imageconfigs` folder includes a set of different image files that define
different image types the Buildkit can produce. For different validated images,
Edge Microvisor Toolkit uses the `edge-image.json`, `edge-image-rt.json`, and image types the
Buildkit can produce.
::::

::::{dropdown} Which BIOS settings should I change to support Edge Microvisor Toolkit?
To install from a USB device, you need to update BIOS to include the
USB boot option and make sure USB boot has highest precedence in the
boot order list. You also need to configure BIOS with the Platform Keys (PK) to enable
[secure boot](./get-started/emt-sb-howto.md) for Edge Microvisor Toolkit.
